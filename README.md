Overview
This repository showcases practical work from the data science portion of the Wipro TalentNext program. It includes:

Data wrangling, cleaning, and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
Model building (supervised/unsupervised)
Evaluation and interpretation
Basic NLP tasks and signal processing concepts
Documentation and reproducibility practices
Each project is designed to be self-contained with clear instructions, reproducible results, and minimal external dependencies.

Notes:

Some folders may contain notebooks, scripts, or small data files.
Each project typically includes:
A short description
Setup/requirements (if needed)
Instructions to run (commands)
Expected outputs or plots
Key code snippets or functions
Tech Stack
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk/spacy (for NLP), regex
Notebooks or Python scripts
Optional: Git and GitHub for collaboration
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wipro_talentnext_python.git
cd wipro_talentnext_python
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies (adjust if you have per-project requirements):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If there isn't a global requirements.txt, install per-project requirements from inside each folder as needed.

Running Projects
Jupyter notebooks:

Start Jupyter: jupyter notebook
Open the target notebook and run cells sequentially.
Python scripts:

bash
python script_name.py
CLI-based projects:

bash
python main.py --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
Each project folder should have its own README with project-specific instructions.

Datasets
Sample2.txt: Example dataset for CLI/processing tasks
Other projects may use synthetic data or small CSV/JSON files created within the repo
Always check the per-project README for data sources, structure, and preprocessing steps
Key Learnings & Techniques
